### **What is Synapse?**
Synapse is a project created by two german official community Server-Hosters. We used Harmony to create a framework which makes it easier for us to implement new functions, game updates and overall a new experience for players.

Synapse itself has a ton of features some of these include:
* Permission system which replaces the Permission system of SCP:SL
* MapPoint API
* Custom Role API
* Custom Item API
* Custom Team API
* Custom Command API
* Dummy API that are able to walk
* API to interact with the Features of SCP:SL
* Database support
* Translation system
* Wrappers for various vanilla-classes

## **Installation**
The installation of Synapse is very easy.

Download the newest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/SynapseSL/Synapse/releases) page.

## **Developers**
